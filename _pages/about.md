I am a Research Scientist at the [Distributed Systems Security](https://research.csiro.au/cybersecurity-quantum-systems/about/iot-cloud-security/) team of CSIRO's Data61. Before joining Data61, I was a Research Fellow at the Cyber Security Group of Monash University, Australia. I obtained my PhD degree from Monash University in 2020.

My research focuses on the security and privacy issues of network systems deployed with popular techniques, such as End-to-End Encryption communications, network function virtualisation and AI. Also, my research aims to systematically adopt privacy-enhancing technologies to guarantee identity/data confidentiality, protect critical network infrastructures and resources, as well as improve the reliability of next generation networks, e.g., networks with the Zero-Trust architecture and 5G&Beyond mobile wireless communications.
